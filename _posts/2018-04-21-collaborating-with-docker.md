I had the opportunity to be the opening keynote speaker for the Blacksburg Open Source Dev Conference.  Attendees were a range of students and local professionals.

This was my first time speaking in the "New Classroom Building" (yes... that's the name) on the Virginia Tech campus. What made it unique was the speaker platform was in the middle of the room, giving a 360&deg; audience. Interesting, but actually pretty cool!
