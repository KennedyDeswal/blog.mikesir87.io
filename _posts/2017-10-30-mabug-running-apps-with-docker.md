Presentation give to the Mid-Atlantic Banner User Group, a collection of 36 universities, on October 30, 2017 on the Virginia Tech campus. Open the speaker notes for what each demo covered.

This was a fun talk to give, as I tried to cover more of "securing the software supply chain" through demos. I'd like to do a more focused version that starts with the assumption that the audience already knows what containers are and spend time demoing/diving in to Notary and signing of images. Anywho... here are the slides (after a quick #dockerselfie)!
