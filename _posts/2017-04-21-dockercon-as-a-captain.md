DockerCon 2017 is now over and was a fantastic experience (thanks [Ashlynn](https://twitter.com/AshlynnPolini), [Jenny](https://twitter.com/TheBurce), and the whole crew)!  I was fortunate to attend last year's DockerCon as well and was yet another attendee trying to drink from the firehose.  This year, it was a completely different experience and I'd like to highlight some of those differences.


## My Journey to Captain

<strong>August 2015</strong> - we started playing with Docker on my team at Virginia Tech.  We were trying to figure out how to build reproducable and isolated environments for our QA environment to test individual features before being merged into the main codebase.  We had HUGE success with it.  

<strong>June 2016</strong> - I was sent to DockerCon and basically told, "Figure out how to get Virginia Tech using Docker."  Uh... ok!  I learned a ton, but learned that the best thing I can do is start a local community meetup.

At this point, I also joined the Docker Community Slack team.  I was immediately impressed when I ran into a problem, [Marcos Nils](twitter.com/marcosnils) took the time to help me debug an issue I was having using a remote terminal session.  It was at this point that I realized how awesome this community was and I _really_ needed to be a part of it.

<strong>September 2016</strong> - the inaugural meeting of the Docker Blacksburg Meetup. We had 30ish people and only three of them had ever used Docker beforehand.

<strong>October 2016-now</strong> - we've held monthly meetings where I've been the sole presenter so far (minus one awesome chat from Jon Armstrong at Rackspace). I developed many presentations, hands-on labs, and more to help others learn.

I also worked closely with [Lisa McNicol](https://twitter.com/LisaMcNicol) to help kick-off the Campus Ambassador. This program is going to be a fantastic opportunity for higher education students to get involved, as well as boost their own skills and resume.

<strong>March 2017</strong> - I was notified that I had been nominated and approved to join the Docker Captain group.


## The DockerCon Experience

There are a few ways in which this DockerCon was so much better.
