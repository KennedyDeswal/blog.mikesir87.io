[Docker Secrets](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/secrets/) is an incredibly powerful and useful feature that helps build secure applications.  If you haven't checked out the great talk from Riyaz Faizullabhoy and Diogo MÃ³nica at DockerCon about how they _truly_ put security first in Docker, you really SHOULD stop and watch it now.

Now that you've watched that, you know how great secrets are and why you should be using them!  They're awesome! But... **how do we get used to using them during development**?  Here are three ways (according to me anyways) on how to use secrets during development:

1. Run a Swarm
2. Mount your own secret files
3. Dynamically create secrets using a "simulator"

There are definitely pros and cons to each method, so let's dive in and look at each method!


## Method One: Run a Swarm

In your local environment, you could simply spin up a Swarm (`docker swarm init` and then `docker stack deploy -c docker-stack.yml app`)

- **Pros**
  - Exact same setup that would be used in non-development environments
  - Could scale out your local environment with multiple nodes to add capacity
- **Cons**
  - Can't use the `build` directive in your stack file to build an image for your development environment
  - If using more than one node, you likely won't be able to mount your source code into the container for faster development
  - Can get confusing if you have a stack file for production but a different one for development


## Method Two: Mount your own secret files

It would be nice if we didn't have to use a Swarm locally to be able to use the `build` directive and allow us to mount our source code. Since Docker secrets are made available to applications as files mounted at `/run/secrets`, there's nothing preventing us from faking it all by mounting the secrets ourselves. So, imagine we had a project structure like this...

```
docker/
  app/
    Dockerfile
  secrets/
    DB_USERNAME
    DB_PASSWORD
    DB_NAME
src/
```

We could have a docker-compose.yml file that looks like this:

<pre class="no-wrap language-yaml" data-title="docker-compose.yml"><code class="yaml">version: "3.1"

services:
  app:
    build: ./docker/app
    volumes:
      - ./docker/app/secrets:/run/secrets
      - ./src:/app
</code></pre>

Now, running `docker-compose up`, our local environment will be built and the secrets will be mounted to `/run/secrets`. Everything will work just the same as Method #1, but without the complexities of running a full swarm.

- **Pros**
  - Don't need a full swarm
  - Can use familiar `docker-compose up` (and other Compose tools) to spin up the dev environment
  - Even though the secrets aren't delievered via Swarm, the app doesn't know and doesn't care
- **Cons**
  - Need a file per secret. More secrets = more files
  - Have to look at filesystem to see what secrets are available and their values


## Method Three: Dynamically create secrets using a "simulator"

Building on the success of the previous method, it would be nice to remove the need of maintaining a collection of secrets files.  So... I've created a ["Docker Secrets Simulator"](https://github.com/mikesir87/docker-secrets-simulator) image that "converts" environment variables to secrets. Using this approach, I can define everything within the docker-compose file and no longer need a lot of extra files. I only need to add one more service to my docker-compose file.  Here's what the updated compose file looks like...

<pre class="no-wrap language-yaml" data-title="docker-compose.yml"><code class="yaml">version: "3.1"

services:
  secret-simulator:
    image: mikesir87/secrets-simulator
    volumes:
      secrets:/run/secrets:rw
    environment:
      DB_USERNAME: admin
      DB_PASSWORD: password1234!
      DB_NAME: development
  app:
    build: ./docker/app/
    volumes:
      - ./src:/app
      - secrets:/run/secrets:ro

volumes:
  secrets:
    driver: local
</code></pre>

The [mikesir87/secrets-simulator](https://hub.docker.com/r/mikesir87/secrets-simulator/) image converts all environment variables to files in the `/run/secrets` directory. To make them available to the app service, I simply created a persistent volume and mounted it to both services. You'll also notice that I mounted the volume as read-only for the app, preventing accidental changes.

- **Pros**
  - All Pros from Method #2 above
  - All secrets are defined in the docker-compose file, giving a single spot to see all secrets and values
- **Cons**
  - None that I can think of yet!


## Conclusion

If you're planning to use Swarm in production, it's good to get in the habit of using Docker Secrets in local development. Using my new `mikesir87/secrets-simulator` image makes it easier, but any of the above methods will do the job.  If you have other ideas, let me know!
