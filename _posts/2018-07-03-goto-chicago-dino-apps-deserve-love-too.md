I had the chance to speak at the GOTO Conference in Chicago on April 25, 2018. It was actually my first time presenting at a conference that was outside of Virginia! So... I'm becoming famous now, right? I can hope so anyways.

Anywho... hope you enjoy and let me know if you have any feedback or additional questions!

## Abstract

We all have them... dino (legacy) apps that no one wants to touch, let alone "modernize" by breaking it apart and creating microservices. While Docker is often seen as a tool to support microservices, what if you REALLY don't want to change the app? It's just too risky, right? Not at all. In fact, it's too risky NOT to containerize that dino.

Come prepared to hear of the benefits, learn best practices, and even see a dino app get updated to enjoy the benefits of being moved into a modern software supply chain, especially the security-related benefits. And who knows? There may even be some dino surprises, so be ready for anything!
